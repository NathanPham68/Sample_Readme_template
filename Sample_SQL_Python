## ⚒️ Main Process

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3️⃣ SQL/ Python Analysis 

👉🏻 First, explain codes' purpose - what they do.

*_Example_*

## Task 1: Analyze bounce rate...

Bounce rate represents the percentage of website sessions where users visit only one page and leave without interacting further with the site. A high bounce rate can indicate that visitors are not [....]


👉🏻 Then how your query/ code & Insert screenshots of your result

  If your result is a very long table with many records, only show top 5/10 and bottom 5/10 rows, or records that relevant to the insights/ observation below
